# config sample for kernel-only spot-build
# also useful as a starting point for minimal builds of other pkgs
# can also be used as an override.conf
#
# minimal steps:
#  create a disposable buildvm with 10GB of private space
#    5GB base + 5GB for each kernel version you want to build
#  $ git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder
#  $ cd qubes-builder
#  $ cp example-configs/kernel.conf builder.conf
#  adjust/customize release/branch/giturl as needed
#  $ make get-sources
#  $ make install-deps
#  adjust/customize contents of qubes-src/linux-kernel
#   want to up/downgrade? 
#     adjust "version" (and rerun get-sources)
#   want to mark your kernel? 
#     add tag/name to rel 
#     but make sure it still starts with a digit!
#   want to add some custom modules that have a Kconfig/Kbuild?
#     grep for "wireguard" or "u2mfn" for examples
#       download+verify steps go into "Makefile"
#       build+install steps go into "kernel.spec.in"
#       or check custom-interactive mode below
#   want to change kernel config/options? 
#     add them to the end of "config-qubes"
#  $ make qubes
#  this should take about forever
#    lists three generated .rpm at the end
#    transfer these to dom0 and install
#  want to go custom-interactive?
#    $ sudo chroot chroot-dom0-fc25 su user
#    $ cd /home/user/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-latest-X.Y.Z/linux-X.Y.Z
#    this is the kernel tree you just built the rpms from
#    so you can change+rebuild mods here and 
#    qvm-copy + insmod them in an appvm that runs your pkgd kernel
#
